# Run a 27 years old Pinball Machine in your browser

In this talk Michael will show you how to emulate a 27 years old Williams pinball machine
in your browser. He will demonstrate step by step how the emulator was build.

He will explain how to emulate the CPU, ASIC, a dot matrix controller and other hardware
in JavaScript and the underlying architecture of the emulator to provide tick accurate
timing.
His goal is to show that emulating is not black magic...

This talk also features a live demo of the Williams Pinball emulator, including how to
visualise internal emulator state to help debugging.
